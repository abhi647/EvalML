AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning.The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning. Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models. AutoML has been used to compare the relative importance of each factor in a prediction model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is EvalML?\nEvalML is an open source automated machine learning library created by Altryx's Innovation team EvalML is an AutoML library that builds, optimizes, and evaluates machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions.\n\nBasically EvalML provides a simple low code interface to create machine learning model and use those models to generate insights and to make accurate predictions.    \n\n## What I liked the most about EvalML\n\n- EvalML cuts downs the process of model training and tuning by hand, this includes data quality checks and cross-validation.\n\n- Data Checks and warnings: EvalML helps you in identifying the probelm in the data before using or setting it up for modelling\n\n- Pipeline building: EvalML helps you in consructing a highly optimised pipeline including a state-of-the-art data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection and a lot pf modelling techniques \n\n- Model Understanding: Just like Shap, Eli5, Lime and other model explanibility libraries EvalML also provides a broad level of understanding about the model you are building, for the purpose of presentation\n\n- Domain-specific: This is the missing link in most of the AutoML libraries where you can define the objective if the problem. Once you have determined the objective for your business, you can provide that to EvalML to optimize by defining a custom objective function.
